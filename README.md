# CS 465 Security Project

Caleb Dingus, Emmanuel Onwuka, Mardigon Toler

A demonstration of a faked login client that phishes user information and, sperately, a modification of part of the source code for the jEdit source code editor demonstrating how open source projects can be maliciously tampered with and redistributed via unofficial media.

Both of these demonstrations send user information to a server running a Python script that captures data over a socket.
